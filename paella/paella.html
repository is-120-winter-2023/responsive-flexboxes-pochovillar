        <p>Sofrito
          ½ cup of sofrito (can be purchased at the supermarket)
          To prepare the sofrito you will need:
          1 ½ cup of diced onions, 2 minced garlic cloves (or frozen minced garlic), and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
          400g of diced canned or fresh tomatoes. Sauté until onions are soft. (Once cooled, blend or use directly
          without blending).
          You can freeze excess sofrito and use it the next time you make paella.
          Vegetables
          1 ½ cups of vegetables (red bell pepper, green beans, mushrooms, artichokes, peas, red onion) (can use frozen)
          ¼ cup of chopped parsley, divided in half

        <p>NOW IT'S TIME TO COOK!!
          -Heat 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil in the paella pan over medium heat.
          -Add the chicken, brown and cook for a few minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate.
          -If using shrimp, follow the same process as with the chicken.
          -Add more oil to the pan. Add the vegetables and brown for a few minutes.
          -Add the sofrito, stir. Add the rice, stir and then the broth. Stir making sure everything that is stuck to
          the bottom of the pan comes loose.
          -Distribute the vegetables over the rice, without stirring.
          -Let cook for 5 minutes.
          -Add the chicken, nestling it into the rice, without stirring. Cook for about 5 minutes.
          -Add the shrimp on top of the rice and sprinkle with the almonds.
          -Cook until the rice is done. If more liquid is needed, add more broth.
          -Once the rice is done, increase the heat for 1-2 minutes to form the socarrat (the almost burnt layer of rice
          at the bottom of the paella).
          -Turn off the heat, cover the paella with a lid, aluminum foil, or a kitchen towel for 10 minutes.
          -Sprinkle with parsley and decorate with lemon
